  "validation_prompt": "After completing any coding activity, validate the coded elements using the following process:\n\n1. **Initial Assessment**: Review the coded implementation to understand what components and features have been created or modified.\n\n2. **Figma Comparison (if Figma links are provided)**:\n   - If Figma frame links or design references are attached, compare the coded implementation against the Figma designs\n   - Check for visual accuracy including:\n     * Layout and spacing\n     * Colors and typography\n     * Component structure and hierarchy\n     * Interactive states (hover, active, disabled, etc.)\n     * Responsive behavior (if applicable)\n   - Verify that all design specifications from Figma are correctly implemented\n\n3. **Code Quality Check**:\n   - Review code structure and organization\n   - Ensure proper naming conventions are followed\n   - Verify that design token values from tokens.json are used instead of hardcoded values (colors, spacing, typography, border radius, shadows, etc.)\n   - Check for accessibility considerations\n   - Verify component props and interfaces match requirements\n   - Confirm proper error handling where applicable\n\n4. **Functional Validation**:\n   - Verify all interactive elements work as expected\n   - Test edge cases and error states\n   - Confirm responsive behavior (if applicable)\n   - Validate data flow and state management (if applicable)\n\n5. **Iterative Validation Process**:\n   - Perform up to a maximum of 3 validation loops\n   - Each loop consists of:\n     a. Comparing coded results with Figma design (if applicable)\n     b. Identifying discrepancies or issues\n     c. Documenting findings\n     d. Making corrections if needed\n     e. Re-validating after corrections\n   - After 3 loops, document remaining issues or confirm validation complete\n\n6. **Documentation**:\n   - Document any deviations from the design (with justification if intentional)\n   - Note any limitations or constraints discovered during validation\n   - Record any recommended improvements for future iterations",
